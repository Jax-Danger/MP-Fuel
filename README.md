## Get vehicle fuel level

This is an incredibly complicated task for some people, and they often ask for exports to do it.
You use the native function [GetVehicleFuelLevel](https://docs.fivem.net/natives/?_0x5F739BB8), or you can use a statebag.


This script requires the Main Power Framework and Main Power Inventory in order to be used. As of 09/25/2024, MP-Inventory is not released.
